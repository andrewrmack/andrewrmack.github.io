  <h1>Andrew's Coding Blog</h1>
   <p>Here's where I'll be recording some notes on coding, computers,
      electricity, math, and other other things that might be of interest to
      programmers. I use MathJax to render equations, so some of my posts
      will not display properly if you have javascript blocked</p>
   <p>Let's Test MathJax while we're here:
    $$\Phi=\oint_{S}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}$$</p>
